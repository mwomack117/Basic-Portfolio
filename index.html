            <p class="p-index">Michael Womack is a student of life, always striving to learn and become a better human. Michael has been working in 
                restaurants and bars for the last 10 years. He is currently taking a huge step in self-development by taking the UCLA 
                Full-Stack coding Bootcamp. Starting this journey with minimal experience in coding is both exciting and little scary for him. 
                One of his biggest motivations to work though the challenges of the course is his strong desire for a career change.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p-index">One of his favorite things to do when he isn't working is traveling with his camera and exploring other cultures. His most recent trip was 
                a six week backpacking adventure in 2017 to Indonesia and Thailand. He saw wild orangutans in the jungles of Sumatra, visited ancient
                holy temples in Java and relaxed on remote beaches in Lombok and Bali.
